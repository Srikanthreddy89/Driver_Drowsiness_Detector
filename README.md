# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
One of the main causes of many auto accidents is driver weariness and drowsiness. A significant problem in the field of accident prevention systems is the development and upkeep of technologies that can effectively detect or prevent tiredness at the wheel and warn the driver before an accident. The problems that drowsiness can pose on the road require the development of strategies to mitigate its impact. With the development of technology and real-time scanner systems using cameras, we can prevent serious traffic accidents by warning the motorist who is starting to nod off.<br>
Because of the nature of the issue, drowsiness/fatigue is a safety issue that no nation in the world has fully addressed. In contrast to drugs and alcohol, which have obvious essential tests and signs that are readily available on the market, drowsiness is generally very difficult to measure or observe. The goal of our <b>prototype Driver Drowsiness Detector (DDD)</b> is to monitor the condition of the driverâ€™s eyes continually and correctly in real time to determine whether they have been open or closed for longer than a certain amount of time.
